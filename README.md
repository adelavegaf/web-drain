# WebDrain

Meteor web application that shows you statistics related to the time you have spent visiting websites in Google Chrome. These statistics are obtained through our Chrome Extension that is left in a separate repository.

## Development

Since the webpage is powered by Meteor, all you have to do is:

`meteor npm install`  
`meteor`

This would effectively run the backend, the frontend, and a local instance of MongoDB.
